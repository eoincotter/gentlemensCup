        <h1>The Gentlemen's Cup Rules</h1>
        <p>The Gentlemen's Cup will take place over the summer months, consisting of a number of official events played
            throughout the summer and culminating in a final championship round in late August/early September (course 
            and date to be confirmed).
        </p>
        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>Prior to the final championship round, each player's overall score will be calculated by the average of their 
            four best stableford scores* from the official events they have played. </p>
        <ul><li>Overall Score: (best score + second best score + third best score + fourth best score)/4</li></ul>
        <p><i>*Maximum of two par 3 course scores can be included in the four.</i></p>
        <p>All players who submit 4 rounds from official events will qualify for the championship round.</p>
        <p>The final championship round will then count as a double score towards each player's final score, which will
            be calculated by the average of their four best stableford scores from the events throughout the summer and
        the final championship round times 2. </p>
        <ul><li>Final Score: (best score + second best score + third best score + fourth best score +
             championship score x 2)/6</li></ul>
        <h2>How Does a Round Become an Official Gentlemen's Cup Event?</h2>
        <p>For a round to qualify as an official Gentlemen's Cup event it must meet the following conditions:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The round is played over 18 holes on a par 3 or full-length golf course (no pitch 'n' putt)</li>
            <!--<li>The round is played outside of standard working hours (9am - 5pm on working days)</li>-->
            <li>The intention to play an official round at an approximate time and date has been announced in 
                the Whatsapp group to the other players prior to booking, with an open invitation for others to join.</li>
        </ul>
        <!--<p>The latter two rules are in place to avoid playing in cliques and excluding others from the opportunity to
            play in official events.
        </p>-->
        <!--<p>Exceptions to these rules can be made for players who have a valid reason for 
            struggling to meet the requisite number of rounds (4) to qualify for the championship round.
        </p>-->
        <h2>Handicaps</h2>
        <p>Handicaps will carry forward from last year where applicable. New participants will be assigned a handicap based
            on perceived playing ability unless they have a GUI handicap.</p>
        <p>Handicaps will be adjusted based on stableford scores in official events:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>All Handicaps:</b> Score less than 36 points: Handicap increases by 0.1.</li>
            <li><b>All Handicaps:</b> Score 36 points: No handicap change.</li>
            <li><b>Handicap plus to 5:</b> Score over 36 points: Handicap decreases by 0.1 for every point over 36.</li>
            <li><b>Handicap 6 to 12:</b> Score over 36 points: Handicap decreases by 0.2 for every point over 36.</li>
            <li><b>Handicap 13 to 20:</b> Score over 36 points: Handicap decreases by 0.3 for every point over 36.</li>
            <li><b>Handicap 21 to 28:</b> Score over 36 points: Handicap decreases by 0.4 for every point over 36.</li>
            <li><b>Handicap 29 to 36:</b> Score over 36 points: Handicap decreases by 0.5 for every point over 36.</li>
            <li><b>Handicap greater than 36:</b> Score over 36 points: Handicap decreases by 0.6 for every point over 36.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Local Rules</h2>
        <p>The following rules are in play to ease participation for the less experienced golfer and to improve pace of play:</p>
        <p>If your handicap is 36 or greater, fresh air shots are not counted. Otherwise they are.</p>
        <p>If a ball is lost or hit out of bounds, a penalty drop can be taken at the point where the ball is 
            believed to be lost or where the ball is believed to have exited the boundary of the course.</p>
        <h2>Prizes</h2>
        <p>All players must pay an entry fee (to be confirmed), which will fund the following prizes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Gentlemen's Cup Champion:</b> Highest final score*</li>
            <li><b>Summer Series Champion:</b> Highest overall Score (excluding the championship round)*</li>
            <li><b>Championsip Round Winner:</b> Highest stableford score in the championship round*</li>
            <li><b>May/June Player of the Month:</b> Highest average score for events played in May or June**</li>
            <li><b>July Player of the Month:</b> Highest average score for events played in July**</li>
            <li><b>August Player of the Month:</b> Highest average score for events played in August**</li>
        </ul>
        <p><i>*Where one player is the winner in multiple categories they will be awarded only the most prestigious award.
            The player with the next best score will be awarded the prize where this occurs.</i>
        </i></p>
        <p><i>**Minimum 2 rounds. There are no restrictions on the number of player of the month awards won by a single player.</i></p>
